# AI-Powered Conversation Summary Test

## WorldBuilderChat AI Summary Function

### How It Works:
The system sends older messages to AI with this prompt:
```
Please provide a concise summary of our world building conversation above. Focus on:
- Key characters mentioned (names and roles)  
- Important locations discussed
- Factions, organizations, or groups
- Religions or belief systems
- World details (magic, technology, culture, history)
- Any other significant world building elements

Format: "Discussed [topics]. Key elements: [names/places]. [Brief context]"
Keep it under 100 words and focus on concrete details.
```

### Sample Input Messages:
```javascript
const testMessages = [
  { role: 'user', content: 'I want to create a fantasy world with elves and dwarves' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Great! Tell me about the elves. Where do they live?' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'The elves live in Rivendell, a beautiful forest city. Their king is Thranduil.' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'And what about the dwarves?' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'The dwarves have their kingdom in the Lonely Mountain. Thorin is their leader.' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'There are also orcs who serve the dark lord Sauron in Mordor.' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Tell me about the magic system in your world.' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'Magic comes from ancient rings of power. The technology level is medieval.' },
];
```

- **Structured Prompts**: Specific prompts for world building vs arc planning contexts
- **Low Temperature**: Uses temperature 0.1 for consistent, factual summaries
- **Context Awareness**: Tells AI how many messages analyzed vs total older messages
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation to simple summaries if AI fails
- **Error Recovery**: Try-catch blocks prevent summary failures from breaking chat
- **Context-Specific**: Different prompts optimize for world building vs story planning
- **Token Efficient**: Summaries are concise but information-rich, focusing on most relevant recent content
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking summary generation with loading indicators
